  <p>
    According to a 2007 New York Times article,"Audi sets out to turn heads — and take over the luxury car market," the company was focused on a strategy to gain market share by emphasizing future-oriented design and innovation rather than focusing on its relatively short history. This strategic shift aimed to challenge established luxury automakers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW by becoming the leading luxury car manufacturer globally.  
<br><br>Focus on the future: At the time, the company was making a conscious effort to build its brand around innovation and the future, rather than dwelling on its past. This approach was designed to differentiate it from competitors with longer, more established histories.
<br><br>Strategic goal: The company's leadership had set an ambitious goal of becoming the number one luxury car brand in the world by 2015.
<br><br>Market context: This strategy was developed amid a period of significant change in the luxury car market, where Audi was identified as a fast-growing brand, notes this New York Times article.
